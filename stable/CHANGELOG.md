# Changelog

## 2.0.1

- Fix url for API requests

## 2.0.0

- Almond was updated to 2.0.0: this is a major release that
  brings significant changes to the supported skills. Additional
  details are in the release notes: https://wiki.almond.stanford.edu/en/release-planning/two-point-oh
  All users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, because
  the previous release line is unmaintained and unsupported. Cloud
  services that Almond relies on might drop compatibility with
  Almond 1.* at some point in the future.
- Voice support is now included in this addon, and the Ada add-on
  is not required (in fact, it should not be enabled at the same time).
