[Almond] provides a complete solution to turn your Home Assistant
into a smart speaker. It supports playing music, controlling your
IoT, checking the weather, and other simple questions.

To use Almond, you should connect a microphone and speaker to the
device where Home Assistant is installed.

**Note**: since version 2.0.0 of the add-on, the use of the separate
Ada add-on is not required. Almond includes built-in voice capabilities,
using the wake-word "computer". It is recommended to avoid using Ada
with Almond >= 2.0.0.
